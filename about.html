                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold pt-4">Our Mission</h2>
                <p>In a world of complex financial transactions, it's easy to lose track of where your money is goingâ€”especially when it comes to taxes. GST, TDS, Cess, and other charges are often hidden in plain sight within lengthy bank statements. We wanted to change that.</p>
                <p>Tax Lens was created with a simple mission: **to provide every Indian consumer, freelancer, and small business owner with a free, safe, and easy way to see the taxes they pay.** We believe that transparency leads to awareness, and awareness leads to better financial decisions.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold pt-4">Why We Built It</h2>
                <p>We were curious about how much tax we were paying through everyday transactions. But we couldn't find a tool that could quickly give us an answer without requiring us to upload our sensitive financial data to a third-party server. We weren't comfortable with that, and we figured others weren't either.</p>
                <p>So, we built the tool we wanted to use: one that is powerful yet respects user privacy above all else. By processing everything directly in your browser, Tax Lens ensures that your financial information never leaves your control.</p>
